<h1>SpaConcierge – Terms of Service for Messaging</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: <span id="d"></span></small></p>

<p>These Terms govern your participation in the SpaConcierge messaging program
(the “Program”). By providing your mobile number to a participating spa or clinic,
you agree to receive service-related text messages as described below.</p>

<h2>1. Program purpose</h2>
<p>SpaConcierge helps spas and clinics connect with their clients through
service-related SMS. Messages may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Missed-call follow-ups</li>
  <li>Appointment confirmations</li>
  <li>Appointment reminders</li>
  <li>Reschedule options</li>
  <li>Basic customer-care replies</li>
</ul>
<p>Messages are one-to-one and are <strong>not marketing blasts</strong>. We do not use your
number for unrelated promotions.</p>

<h2>2. How to opt in</h2>
<p>You opt in by giving your phone number to a participating spa when you call,
book an appointment online, or fill out an intake form. By doing so, you consent
to receive service-related texts powered by SpaConcierge.</p>

<h2>3. Message frequency &amp; fees</h2>
<p>Typical frequency is <strong>1–3 messages per appointment</strong>. Message and data rates
may apply, depending on your carrier and plan.</p>

<h2>4. Opt-out &amp; customer care</h2>
<p>You may opt out at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong>. You will receive a confirmation
that you have unsubscribed. After that, you will no longer receive messages unless
you opt in again. For help, reply <strong>HELP</strong> or contact
<a href="mailto:matt@getspaconcierge.com">matt@getspaconcierge.com</a>.</p>

<h2>5. No sensitive health information</h2>
<p>Messages are designed to be service-neutral and must not include protected
health information (PHI) or treatment details (e.g., “Botox at 3 PM”). If you see
a message with such details, please notify your spa immediately.</p>

<h2>6. Program eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old (or 16 where required by law) to participate.
If you are under 18, you should have consent from a parent or guardian.</p>

<h2>7. Privacy</h2>
<p>We respect your privacy. Your number is used only to deliver the messages
described in these Terms. See our <a href="/smsprivacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more detail.</p>

<h2>8. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
<p>We do not guarantee that messages will be delivered without delay or error.
Carriers and service providers are not responsible for delayed or undelivered
messages.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, SpaConcierge and participating spas
are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your
participation in the Program. Our total liability is limited to the amount of fees you
paid to your carrier for the affected messages.</p>

<h2>10. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be posted here
with a new “Last updated” date. Your continued participation constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
