<h1>SpaConcierge – Terms of Service</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: <span id="d"></span></small></p>

<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the SpaConcierge
website, messaging features, and related services (collectively, the “Service”). “We,”
“us,” and “our” mean the owner of SpaConcierge. “You” means the spa, clinic, or
business using the Service. If you are accepting on behalf of a business, you represent
that you have authority to bind that business.</p>

<h2>1. What SpaConcierge does</h2>
<p>SpaConcierge helps spas turn missed calls into booked appointments through
one-to-one messaging (SMS and, where enabled, WhatsApp) and light automations
(e.g., confirmations, reminders, reschedules). The Service is not a medical service and
does not provide medical advice.</p>

<h2>2. Your responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consent.</strong> You will only message people who provided their number to you and
      consented to receive service-related texts. You will honor STOP/HELP immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>No PHI.</strong> Do not send protected health information or treatment-specific details
      (e.g., “Botox at 10:30”). Use service-neutral wording (e.g., “appointment”).</li>
  <li><strong>Content rules.</strong> No spam; no SHAFT content (sexually explicit, hate, alcohol (where restricted),
      firearms, tobacco/vaping); no illegal, deceptive, or abusive content.</li>
  <li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> You are responsible for your hours, services, pricing, and links you provide.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance.</strong> You will follow carrier/CTIA rules, A2P 10DLC policies, and applicable laws.
      You are responsible for any fees or fines arising from your use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Our responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HIPAA-aware approach.</strong> We design workflows to avoid PHI, but we do not represent
      that the Service is HIPAA-compliant. Do not use the Service to store or transmit PHI.</li>
  <li><strong>Reasonable safeguards.</strong> We use reputable providers (e.g., Twilio, Netlify, Google)
      and apply reasonable security measures appropriate for a lightweight scheduling-assist tool.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Messaging program (A2P 10DLC)</h2>
<p>Program name: SpaConcierge. Message types: one-to-one, service-related
updates (missed-call follow-ups, confirmations, reminders, reschedules).
Frequency: typically 1–3 messages per appointment. Message and data rates may apply.
Reply <strong>HELP</strong> for help. Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to opt out. Carriers are not liable for
delayed or undelivered messages.</p>

<h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
<p>We rely on providers such as Twilio (telecom), Netlify (hosting), Google (Sheets/Workspace),
Calendly (scheduling), and analytics/cookie tools. Your use of those services may be
subject to their terms.</p>

<h2>6. Fees &amp; billing</h2>
<p>Plans may include platform fees plus pass-through carrier/usage charges. We may
suspend or terminate for non-payment. Taxes are your responsibility.</p>

<h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No unsolicited marketing blasts.</li>
  <li>No auto-dialed or auto-generated spam.</li>
  <li>No harvesting/scraping of numbers.</li>
  <li>No phishing, malware, or links to unsafe sites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
<p>We retain all rights to the Service and our materials. You retain rights to your marks
and content. You grant us a limited license to use your name/logo to identify you as a
customer, unless you opt out by emailing <a href="mailto:matt@getspaconcierge.com">matt@getspaconcierge.com</a>.</p>

<h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
WE DO NOT GUARANTEE DELIVERABILITY OR TIMELINESS OF MESSAGES.</p>

<h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID
FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 3 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>

<h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You will defend and indemnify us from claims, fines, and costs arising out of your
breach of these Terms or your violation of laws/carrier rules.</p>

<h2>12. Suspension &amp; termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate if we reasonably believe your use risks harm, violates
law/carrier rules, or creates security concerns. You may terminate any time by email.
Some provisions survive termination (e.g., fees owed, limitations, indemnities).</p>

<h2>13. Governing law; disputes</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>[STATE/COUNTRY]</strong> without regard to
conflicts rules. Venue and jurisdiction lie in the courts located in <strong>[COUNTY, STATE]</strong>.
You and we waive class actions and agree to bring claims individually.</p>

<h2>14. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms; material changes will be posted with a new “Last
updated” date. Continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>15. Contact</h2>
