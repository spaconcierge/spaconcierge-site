Purpose: we collect explicit consent by voice or keypad during inbound calls to participating spas.

IVR Script (exact words the caller hears):
“Thanks for calling. We can text you booking help and appointment updates.
To receive texts, press 1 or say “Yes.”
To decline, press 2 or say “No.””
You may receive up to 3 messages per appointment. Message & data rates may apply.
You can get help by replying HELP, or opt out anytime by replying STOP.
Consent is not a condition of purchase.
Our Terms are at https://getspaconcierge.com/smsterms and Privacy Policy is at https://getspaconcierge.com/smsprivacy.

What happens after consent:
If the caller says “Yes” or presses 1, we send a confirmation text that repeats how to get help (HELP) and how to opt-out (STOP).

What happens if the caller declines or does not respond:
We do not send any SMS.
